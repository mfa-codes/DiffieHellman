# DiffieHellman

This is a smaller short code for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This code I wrote completely in Python. The file "DiffieHellman.py" contains the method for key exchange. The file "main.py" uses the method and starts the program.

Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method for securely agreeing on a shared session key between two communication partners over a potentially insecure transmission medium
